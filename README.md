# Get_next_line
This project is the final starting project before branching out. The goal is to make a function which reads a single line from a file descriptor, assuming it isn't being tampered with in between calls to the function.

It must fit in one source file and one header. Mine works with multiple file descriptors. It also has no memory leaks (hurray)!
